# What's new

The word-mathing within a line is allowed here.

For example, by pressing <Leader><Leader>lw, all words in the line will be highlighted:

    {f}Lorem {e}ipsum <cursor>dolor {d}sit {c}amet.

The other commands are <LEADER><LEADER>lW, <LEADER><LEADER>le, and <LEADER><LEADER>lE. ("l" stands for the "line")
You could map keys for them as well.

It makes it better to jump words both forward and backward.
